# 📱 Spam Detection of Phishing SMS Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on identifying phishing or spam SMS messages using machine learning techniques. With the rising number of phishing attacks via text messages, this system aims to automate detection and help users safeguard against malicious intent.

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, Lemmatization)
- Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
- Model Training using multiple algorithms:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Final prediction demo

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- NLTK

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains labeled SMS messages classified as either **spam** or **ham**. The data is preprocessed and split into training and test sets for model evaluation.

## 📊 Model Performance

Several models were trained and compared. The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy and other classification metrics. *(Add model performance summary here if desired.)*
